#### schoolmot.csv - motivation and grades in school children <br><span class="tag">\#cross-sectional</span>

This dataset contains information on 900 children from 30 different schools across Scotland. The data was collected as part of a study looking at **whether education-related motivation is associated with school grades. This is expected to be different for state vs privately funded schools.**   
All children completed an 'education motivation' questionnaire, and their end-of-year grade average has been recorded.

#### lmm_jsup.csv - Workplace pride<br><span class="tag">\#cross-sectional</span>

A questionnaire was sent to all UK civil service departments, and the lmm_jsup.csv dataset contains all responses that were received. Some of these departments work as hybrid or 'virtual' departments, with a mix of remote and office-based employees. Others are fully office-based. 

The questionnaire included items asking about how much the respondent believe in the department and how it engages with the community, what it produces, how it operates and how treats its people. A composite measure of 'workplace-pride' was constructed for each employee. Employees in the civil service are categorised into 3 different roles: A, B and C. The roles tend to increase in responsibility, with role C being more managerial, and role A having less responsibility. We also have data on the length of time each employee has been in the department (sometimes new employees come straight in at role C, but many of them start in role A and work up over time). 

We're interested in whether the different roles are associated with differences in workplace-pride.

#### wellbeingwork3.rda - work patterns and mental wellbeing <br><span class="tag">\#longitudinal</span>

The "Wellbeing in Work" dataset contains information on employee wellbeing, assessed at baseline (start of study), 12 months post, 24 months post, and 36 months post.  over the course of 36 months. 
Participants were randomly assigned to one of three employment conditions:

- control: No change to employment. Employees continue at 5 days a week, with standard allocated annual leave quota.    
- unlimited_leave : Employees were given no limit to their annual leave, but were still expected to meet required targets as specified in their job description. 
- fourday_week: Employees worked a 4 day week for no decrease in pay, and were still expected to meet required targets as specified in their job description.

The researchers have two main questions: **Overall, did the participants' wellbeing stay the same or did it change? Did the employment condition groups differ in the how wellbeing changed over the assessment period?**     

Data are available (in **.rda** format) at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/wellbeingwork3.rda](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/wellbeingwork3.rda)

#### toy2.csv - Toys!<br><span class="tag">\#cross-sectional</span>

This example builds on one from the USMR course, where the lectures explored linear regression with a "toy dataset" looking at how **hours of practice influences the reading age** of different toy characters (see [USMR Week 7 Lecture](https://uoepsy.github.io/usmr/2324/lectures/lecture06.html#/learning-to-read-1){target="_blank"}). Here, we broaden our scope to the investigation of how practice affects reading age for **all** toys (not just Martin's Playmobil characters).  

Data are available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/toy2.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/toy2.csv){target="_blank"} containing information on 129 different toy characters that come from a selection of different families/types of toy.

#### LAAwellbeing.csv - mental wellbeing across Scotland<br><span class="tag">\#cross-sectional</span>

Researchers want to study the **relationship between time spent outdoors and mental wellbeing**, across all of Scotland. They contact all the Local Authority Areas (LAAs) and ask them to collect data for them, with participants completing the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), a self-report measure of mental health and well-being, and being asked to estimate the average number of hours they spend outdoors each week. Twenty of the Local Authority Areas provided data.

#### drivingmusicwithin.csv - the influence of music on driving speeds<br><span class="tag">\#repeated-measures</span>

These data are simulated to represent data from a fake experiment, in which participants were asked to drive around a route in a 30mph zone. Each participant completed the route 3 times (i.e. "repeated measures"), but each time they were listening to different audio (either speech, classical music or rap music). Their average speed across the route was recorded. 
This is a fairly simple design, that we might use to ask **"how is the type of audio being listened to associated with driving speeds?"**

This data is from a simulated study that aims to investigate the following research question: 

**How do different types of audio interfere with executive functioning, and does this interference differ depending upon whether or not noise-cancelling headphones are used?** 

30 healthy volunteers each completed the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) - a commonly used test to assess processing speed and motor speed - a total of 15 times. During the tests, participants listened to either no audio (5 tests), white noise (5 tests) or classical music (5 tests). Half the participants listened via active-noise-cancelling headphones, and the other half listened via speakers in the room. Unfortunately, lots of the tests were not administered correctly, and so not every participant has the full 15 trials worth of data.

#### lmm_apespecies.csv & lmm_apeage.csv - dominance in adolescence of great apes<br><span class="tag">\#longitudinal</span>

We have data from a large sample of great apes who have been studied between the ages of 1 to 10 years old (i.e. during adolescence). Our data includes 4 species of great apes: Chimpanzees, Bonobos, Gorillas and Orangutans. Each ape has been assessed on a primate dominance scale at various ages. Data collection was not very rigorous, so apes do not have consistent assessment schedules (i.e., one may have been assessed at ages 1, 3 and 6, whereas another at ages 2 and 8).  

The researchers are interested in examining **how the adolescent development of dominance in great apes differs between species.**  

Data on the dominance scores of the apes are available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/lmm_apeage.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/lmm_apeage.csv){target="_blank"} and the information about which species each ape is are in [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/lmm_apespecies.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/lmm_apespecies.csv){target="_blank"}.

#### lmm_mindfuldeclineFULL.csv - Multi-center Mindful Cognitive Aging<br><span class="tag">\#longitudinal</span><span class="tag">\#more-complex-groupings</span>

A large study involving 14 different research centers is interested in examining **whether engaging in mindfulness can prevent cognitive decline in older adults**. Each site recruits between 15 and 30 participants at age 60, and administer the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE) every 2 years (until participants were aged 78). For each center, roughly half of the participants engaged with daily mindfulness sessions, while the remaining participants did not.

#### stressweek1.csv - CBD drinks and stress levels: Version 1<br><span class="tag">\#longitudinal</span>

Suppose that we conducted an experiment on a sample of 20 staff members from the Psychology department to investigate **effects of CBD consumption on stress over the course of the working week**. Participants were randomly allocated to one of two conditions: the control group continued as normal, and the CBD group were given one CBD drink every day. Over the course of the working week (5 days) participants stress levels were measured using a self-report questionnaire.

#### cogdecline.csv - domain differences in cognitive aging<br><span class="tag">\#longitudinal</span><span class="tag">\#more-complex-groupings</span>

These data are simulated to represent a large scale international study of cognitive aging, for which data from 17 research centers has been combined. The study team are interested in **whether different cognitive domains have different trajectories as people age**. Do all cognitive domains decline at the same rate? Do some decline more steeply, and some less? The literature suggests that scores on cognitive ability are predicted by educational attainment, so they would like to control for this.  

Each of the 17 research centers recruited a minimum of 14 participants (Median = 21, Range 14-29) at age 48, and recorded their level of education (in years). Participants were then tested on 5 cognitive domains: processing speed, spatial visualisation, memory, reasoning, and vocabulary. Participants were contacted for follow-up on a further 9 occasions (resulting in 10 datapoints for each participant), and at every follow-up they were tested on the same 5 cognitive domains. Follow-ups were on average 3 years apart (Mean = 3, SD = 0.8).

The control group of patients received standard sessions offered by the therapists. 
For the treatment group, 10 mins of each sessions was replaced with a specific psychoeducational component, and patients were given relevant tasks to complete between each session. All patients had monthly therapy sessions. Generalised Anxiety Disorder was assessed at baseline and then every visit over 4 months of sessions (5 assessments in total).

### abs_intervention.csv - evaluating an intervention to reduce adolescent aggressive behaviours<br><span class="tag">\#longitudinal</span><span class="tag">\#more-complex-groupings</span>

In 2010 A US state's commissioner for education was faced with growing community concern about rising levels of adolescent antisocial behaviours. 

After a series of focus groups, the commissioner approved the trialing of an intervention in which yearly Parent Management Training (PMT) group sessions were offered to the parents of a cohort of students entering 10 different high schools. Every year, the parents were asked to fill out an informant-based version of the Aggressive Behaviour Scale (ABS), measuring verbal and physical abuse, socially inappropriate behavior, and resisting care. Where possible, the same parents were followed up throughout the child's progression through high school. Alongside this, parents from a cohort of students entering 10 further high schools in the state were recruited to also complete the same informant-based ABS, but were not offered the PMT group sessions.  
The commissioner has two main questions: **Does the presentation of aggressive behaviours increase as children enter the secondary school system? Is there any evidence for the effectiveness of Parent Management Training (PMT) group sessions in curbing the rise of aggressive behaviors during a child's transition into the secondary school system?**

These data are simulated to imitate an experiment that investigates the effect of visual non-verbal communication (i.e. gestures, facial expressions) on joke appreciation. 
`r n_distinct(laughs$ppt)` Participants took part in the experiment, in which they each rated how funny they found a set of `r n_distinct(laughs$joke_id)` jokes. For each participant, the order of these `r n_distinct(laughs$joke_id)` jokes was randomly set for each run of the experiment. For each participant, the set of jokes was randomly split into two halves, with the first half being presented in audio-only, and the second half being presented in audio and video. This meant that each participant saw `r n_distinct(laughs$ppt)/2` jokes with video and `r n_distinct(laughs$ppt)/2` without, and each joke would be presented in with video roughly half of the times it was seen.  

The researchers want to investigate **whether the delivery (audio/audiovideo) of jokes is associated with differences in humour-ratings.**

### NGV.csv - Video game aggression and the dark triad<br><span class="tag">\#repeated-measures</span><span class="tag">\#more-complex-groupings</span>

These data are from an experiment designed to investigate **how the realism of video games is associated with more/less unnecessarily aggressive gameplay, and whether this differs depending upon a) the playing mode (playing on a screen vs VR headset), and b) individual differences in the 'dark triad' personality traits.**  

The experiment involved playing 10 levels of a game in which the objective was to escape a maze. Various obstacles and other characters were present throughout the maze, and players could interact with these by side-stepping or jumping over them, or by pushing or shooting at them. All of these actions took the same amount of effort to complete (pressing a button), and each one achieved the same end (moving beyond the obstacle and being able to continue through the maze).  

Each participant completed all 10 levels twice, once in which all characters were presented as cartoons, and once in which all characters were presented as realistic humans and animals. The layout of the level was identical in both, the only difference being the depiction of objects and characters. For each participant, these 20 levels ($2 \times 10$ mazes) were presented in a random order. Half of the participants played via a screen, and the other half played via a VR headset. For each level played, we have a record of "needless game violence" (NGV) which was calculated via the number of aggressive (pushing/shooting) actions taken (+0.5 for every action that missed an object, +1 for every action aimed at an inanimate object, and +2 for every action aimed at an animate character).  
Prior to the experiment, each participant completed the Short Dark Triad 3 (SD-3), which measures the three traits of machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy.

A researcher is interested in the efficacy of physiotherapy in helping people to regain normal physical functioning. They are curious **whether doing more physiotherapy leads to better outcomes, or if it is possibly that the patients who tend to do more of their exercises tend to have better outcomes**. 20 in-patients from 2 different hospitals (1 private, 1 govt funded) were monitored over the course of their recovery following knee-surgery. Every day, the time each patient spent doing their physiotherapy exercises was recorded. At the end of each day, participants completed the "Time get up and go" task, a measure of physical functioning.

This study is interested in evaluating **whether peoples' hunger levels are associated with their levels of irritability** (i.e., "the hangry hypothesis"), and if this differs between people on a diet vs those who aren't. 81 participants were recruited into the study. Once a week for 5 consecutive weeks, participants were asked to complete two questionnaires, one assessing their level of hunger, and one assessing their level of irritability. The time and day at which participants were assessed was at a randomly chosen hour between 7am and 7pm each week. 46 of the participants were following a five-two diet (five days of normal eating, 2 days of fasting), and the remaining 35 were following no specific diet.

`r nrow(pvtsc)` children from `r length(unique(pvt$school))` schools were included in the study. Children were assessed on a yearly basis for 7 years throughout primary school on a measure of vocabulary administered in English, the Picture Vocab Test (PVT). `r sum(pvtsc$isBilingual==0)` were monolingual English speakers, and `r sum(pvtsc$isBilingual==1)` were bilingual (english + another language). 

Previous research conducted on monolingual children has suggested that that scores on the PVT increase steadily up until the age of approximately 7 or 8 at which point they begin to plateau. The aim of the present study is to **investigate differences in the development of vocabulary between monolingual and bilingual children.**

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
Let's read in the data:  
```{r}
pvt <- read_csv("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/pvt_bilingual.csv")
```

We have 30 distinct schools:
```{r}
n_distinct(pvt$school)
```

And 418 distinct children. Is that right?  
```{r}
n_distinct(pvt$child)
```

Given that the `pvt$child` variable is just the first name of the child, it's entirely likely that there will be, for instance more than one "Martin".  

This says that there are 487!  
```{r}
pvt |> count(school, child) |> nrow()
```

But wait... we could _still_ have issues. What if there were 2 "Martin"s at the same school??
```{r}
pvt |> 
  # count the school-children groups
  count(school, child) |> 
  # arrange the output so that the highest 
  # values of the 'n' column are at the top
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Aha! There are 7 cases where schools have two children of the same name. Remember that each child was measured at 7 timepoints. We shouldn't have people with 14!  

If we actually _look_ at the data, we'll see that it is very neatly organised, with each child's data together. This means that we could feasibly make an educated guess that, e.g., the "Jackson" from "School 3" in rows 155-161 is different from the "Jackson" from "School 3" at rows 190-196. 

Because of the ordering of our data, we can do something like this:  
```{r}
pvt <- 
  pvt |>
  # group by the school and child
  group_by(school, child) |>
  mutate(
    # make a new variable which counts from 1 to 
    # the number of rows for each school-child
    n_obs = 1:n()
  ) |>
  # ungroup the data
  ungroup() |>
  mutate(
    # change it so that if the n_obs is >7, the 
    # child becomes "[name] 2", to indicate they're the second
    # child with that name
    child = ifelse(n_obs>7, paste0(child," 2"), child)
  )
```

Now we have 494!  
```{r}
pvt |> count(school, child) |> nrow()
```

And nobody has anything other than 7 observations!
```{r}
pvt |> count(school, child) |>
  filter(n != 7)
```

Phew!  

Okay, let's just fit an intercept-only model:  
```{r}
# pvt <- read_csv("../../data/bntmono.csv")
pvt_null <- lmer(PVT ~ 1 +  (1 | school/child), data = pvt)
summary(pvt_null)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
vcres = VarCorr(pvt_null) |> as.data.frame()
vcres = round(vcres$vcov,2)
```


As we can see from `summary(bnt_null)`, the random intercept variances are `r vcres[1]` for child-level, `r vcres[2]` for school-level, and the residual variance is `r vcres[3]`.

So child level differences account for $\frac{`r vcres[1]`}{`r paste0(vcres,collapse=" + ")`} = `r round(vcres[1]/sum(vcres),2)`$ of the variance in PVT scores, and child & school differences together account for $\frac{`r paste0(vcres[1:2],collapse=" + ")`}{`r paste0(vcres,collapse=" + ")`} = `r round(sum(vcres[1:2])/sum(vcres),2)`$ of the variance.

Here's an initial plot too:

```{r}
ggplot(pvt, aes(x=age,y=PVT,col=factor(isBilingual)))+
  stat_summary(geom="pointrange")+
  stat_summary(geom="line")
```

I feel like either raw or orthogonal polynomials would be fine here - there's nothing explicit from the study background about stuff "at baseline". There's the stuff about the plateau at 7 or 8, but we can get that from the model plots. Orthogonal will allow us to compare the trajectories overall (their linear trend, the 'curviness' and 'wiggliness').  

An additional benefit of orthogonal polynomials is that we are less likely to get singular fits when we include polynomial terms in our random effects. Remember, raw polynomials are correlated, so often the by-participant variances in raw poly terms are highly correlated. 

I've gone for 3 degrees of polynomials here because the plot above shows a bit of an S-shape for the bilinguals. 

```{r}
pvt <- pvt |> mutate(
  poly1 = poly(age, 3)[,1],
  poly2 = poly(age, 3)[,2],
  poly3 = poly(age, 3)[,3],
  isBilingual = factor(isBilingual)
)
```

These models do not converge.  
I've tried to preserve the by-child random effects of time, because while I think Schools probably _do_ vary, School's all teach the same curriculum, whereas there's _a lot_ of varied things that can influence a child's vocabulary, both in and out of school

From the random effects, we get even more information!  
School's vary in the average child vocab score at mean age with an SD of 4.5.  More school level variation in linear trends than in curvature. Schools with higher vocab scores at the mean age tend to have lower linear increase, and also a more negative curvature.  
Within schools, children vary in the vocab scores at mean age with an SD of 5.9. Lots of child-level variation in curvature and linear increases, slightly less variation in wiggliness.

#### testenhancedlearning.RData<br><span class="tag">\#longitudinal</span><span class="tag">\#more-complex-groupings</span><span class="tag">\#binomial-outcome</span>

An experiment was run to conceptually replicate "test-enhanced learning" (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006): two groups of 25 participants were presented with material to learn. One group studied the material twice (`StudyStudy`), the other group studied the material once then did a test (`StudyTest`). Recall was tested immediately (one minute) after the learning session and one week later. The recall tests were composed of 175 items identified by a keyword (`Test_word`). 

**The critical (replication) prediction is that the `StudyStudy` group perform better on the immediate test, but the `StudyTest` group will retain the material better and thus perform better on the 1-week follow-up test.**  

We have two options for how we measure "test performance":  

A) The time taken to *correctly* recall a given word.  
B) Whether or not a given word was correctly recalled

The following code loads the data into your R environment by creating a variable called `tel`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
load(url("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/testenhancedlearning.RData"))
```

```{r} 
#| echo: false
load(url("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/testenhancedlearning.RData"))
tibble(
  variable=names(tel),
  description=c("Unique Participant Identifier", "Group denoting whether the participant studied the material twice (StudyStudy), or studied it once then did a test (StudyTest)","Time of recall test ('min' = Immediate, 'week' = One week later)","Word being recalled (175 different test words)","Whether or not the word was correctly recalled","Time to recall word (milliseconds)")

#### msmr_trolley.csv - trolley problems<br><span class="tag">\#repeated-measures</span><span class="tag">\#binomial-outcome</span>

The "Trolley Problem" is a thought experiment in moral philosophy that asks you to decide whether or not to pull a lever to divert a trolley. Pulling the lever changes the trolley direction from hitting 5 people to a track on which it will hit one person.  

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/trolley.png")
```

Previous research has found that the "framing" of the problem will influence the decisions people make: 

```{r}
#| echo: false
tribble(
  ~`positive frame`,~`neutral frame`,~`negative frame`,
  "5 people will be saved if you pull the lever; one person on another track will be saved if you do not pull the lever. All your actions are legal and understandable. Will you pull the lever?","5 people will be saved if you pull the lever, but another person will die. One people will be saved if you do not pull the lever, but 5 people will die. All your actions are legal and understandable. Will you pull the lever?",
  "One person will die if you pull the lever. 5 people will die if you do not pull the lever. All your actions are legal and understandable. Will you pull the lever?"
) |> gt::gt()
```

We conducted a study to investigate **whether the framing effects on moral judgements depends upon the stakes (i.e. the number of lives saved)**.  

120 participants were recruited, and each gave answers to 12 versions of the thought experiment. For each participant, four versions followed each of the positive/neutral/negative framings described above, and for each framing, 2 would save 5 people and 2 would save 15 people.

#### monkey social status and problem solving ability<br><span class="tag">\#repeated-measures</span><span class="tag">\#binomial-outcome</span>

Our primate researchers have been busy collecting more data. They have given a sample of Rhesus Macaques various problems to solve in order to receive treats. Troops of Macaques have a complex social structure, but adult monkeys tend can be loosely categorised as having either a "dominant" or "subordinate" status. The monkeys in our sample are either adolescent monkeys, subordinate adults, or dominant adults. Each monkey attempted various problems before they got bored/distracted/full of treats. Each problems were classed as either "easy" or "difficult", and the researchers recorded whether or not the monkey solved each problem. 

We're interested in **how the social status of monkeys is associated with the ability to solve problems**.
